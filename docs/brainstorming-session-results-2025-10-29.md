**Primary Goal:** Improve "ease of use for non-tech people" and "make it fun" for the "Excelence" budgeting tool.
**Guiding Principle:** Make it look less like Excel.

**Technique Chosen:** SCAMPER Method (currently on 'S - Substitute')

**Ideas Generated (S - Substitute):**

*   **For Adding Expenses/Income:**
    *   Substitute the spreadsheet grid with a conversational chat interface (e.g., "I spent $50 on groceries").
    *   Substitute manual entry with a "drag-and-drop" interface (e.g., dragging an icon into a spending jar).
    *   Substitute the form with a "receipt" metaphor for simple entry.
*   **For Categories:**
    *   Substitute text labels with customizable icons or emojis.
    *   Substitute the category list with a visual "envelope" or "jar" system.
*   **For the Overall Vibe:**
    *   Substitute the "calculator" feel with a "game" feel (e.g., points, badges, friendly mascot).
